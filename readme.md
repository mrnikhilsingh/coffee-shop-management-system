   - If these services do not start, you may need to change the ports for Apache and MySQL in the XAMPP settings.

3. Clone the GitHub repository:

   - Head over to C:\xampp\htdocs in your Windows Explorer. (If you installed XAMPP in a different location, you must navigate to that folder instead.)
   - Open the terminal or command prompt in the same folder.
   - Execute the following command to change the directory to `htdocs`:

     ```bash
     cd C:\xampp\htdocs
     ```

4. Clone the repository:

   - Execute the following command to clone the GitHub repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/mrnikhilsingh/coffee-shop-management-system.git
     ```

5. Create and Configure the Database:

   - Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
   - Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in a web browser to access phpMyAdmin.
   - Create a new MySQL database by clicking "new" option on left sidebar. Name it `ns_coffee`.
   - Import the database schema from the provided SQL file (`db/ns_coffee.sql`).

6. Start the Development Server:
   - Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services (If not already).
   - Launch a web browser and visit `http://localhost` and then project folder.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Ns Coffee on your machine.
